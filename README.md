# Bank-Management-System---UML

The Bank Management System is a software application that is designed to manage the daily operations of a bank. It includes various modules that enable the bank to perform tasks such as managing customer accounts, transactions, and loans. The system is designed using Object-Oriented Programming concepts, with a focus on UML diagrams to represent the system's various components. The system includes the following UML diagrams:

 Use Case Diagram: The Use Case diagram represents the various actions that users of the system can perform. These include creating new accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, and applying for loans.
 
 Class Diagram: The Class diagram represents the different classes used in the system, such as Account, Customer, and Transaction. It shows the relationships between these classes and their attributes and methods. 
 
Sequence Diagram: The Sequence diagram represents the interactions between different objects in the system. It shows how messages are passed between objects during various transactions, such as depositing or withdrawing money. 

Activity Diagram: The Activity diagram represents the flow of activities within the system. It shows how various actions, such as creating a new account or applying for a loan, are processed within the system.

 The Bank Management System is designed to be user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that allows bank employees to quickly perform their daily tasks. It includes various security features, such as password protection and data encryption, to ensure that customer data is secure. The system is designed to be scalable, allowing it to handle large volumes of transactions as the bank grows.
 
 Overall, the Bank Management System is an efficient and effective tool for managing a bank's daily operations. Its use of UML diagrams ensures that the system is well-structured and easy to understand, making it easy to maintain and update as the bank's needs change over time.
